## Setup

This is currently a prototype. You can start it by pointing a HTTP server at the project directory, for example by running:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
Whatever your server you are running should tell you where on localhost you have to navigate to see the app.

## Test

Once again start your HTTP server and navigate to http://<your test server>/test/test.html

## Docs

Documentation is written in general JSDoc style. One generator is https://github.com/jsdoc/jsdoc.
